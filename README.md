## Setup Instructions

To run the program:

1. Download the .zip file and extract all contents.
2. Make sure the Numpy and MatPlotLib libraries are installed.
3. With Python 3.8.5 installed, run main.py.

## Notes to Grader

Unless otherwise specified, each prompt in the program accept single integer inputs. The only excepition to this is entering the feature subsets for the raw nearest-neighbor algorithm. For this function, enter single integers separated by spaces.

Also note that the large datasets take a long time to execute. If execution takes too long on the grading machine, then we can provide traces of the large datasets, if needed.
